# Result
### Research Question 1:
- How do different sets of variables (smoking-related, environmental factors, lifestyle-related) contribute to predicting lung cancer levels?

### Answer:

- Smoking-related factors (smoking and passive smoking) contribute significantly to predicting lung cancer levels, with a logistic regression prediction accuracy of 0.76.
- Environmental factors (occupational hazards and air pollution) also play a role in predicting lung cancer levels, with a prediction accuracy of 0.655.
- Lifestyle-related variables (alcohol consumption and balanced diet) contribute to predicting lung cancer levels, with a prediction accuracy of 0.71.
- Combining all these variables results in an improved prediction accuracy of 0.865.

### Research Question 2:
- How effective is logistic regression in predicting lung cancer levels based on different sets of variables?

### Answer:

- Logistic regression demonstrates varying levels of effectiveness in predicting lung cancer levels based on different sets of variables.
It performs best when considering all variables together, indicating the importance of considering multiple factors simultaneously in predicting lung cancer levels.
- The high prediction accuracy of 0.865 for the combined variables suggests that logistic regression is a valuable tool for predicting lung cancer levels in a comprehensive manner.
