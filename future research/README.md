## **Research Summary using Causal Inference Methods:**

*Background/Motivation:*
Causal inference methods are essential for understanding the causal relationships between variables, particularly in complex systems like healthcare. In the context of lung cancer research, causal inference techniques can help elucidate the causal pathways linking environmental and lifestyle factors to lung cancer incidence and severity.

*Research Questions:*
1. What are the causal effects of environmental and lifestyle factors on lung cancer incidence and severity?
2. How can we utilize causal inference methods to identify actionable interventions for reducing lung cancer risk and improving patient outcomes?

*Methods:*
Causal inference methods such as propensity score matching, instrumental variable analysis, and causal mediation analysis will be employed. Propensity score matching will be used to balance confounding variables between treatment groups, while instrumental variable analysis will help identify causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. Causal mediation analysis will further elucidate the mechanisms through which environmental and lifestyle factors influence lung cancer outcomes. This causal inference is discussed in Yarmolinsky (2018), and implemented in García (2018) to examine breast cancer risk factors.

*Potential Results:*
The potential results include identifying specific environmental and lifestyle factors that causally contribute to lung cancer incidence and severity. Additionally, the study may uncover actionable interventions or policies for reducing lung cancer risk based on the identified causal pathways.

*Contributions:*
The study's contributions lie in advancing our understanding of the causal relationships between environmental/lifestyle factors and lung cancer outcomes. By leveraging causal inference methods, the research can inform targeted interventions and public health policies aimed at reducing the burden of lung cancer.

## **Research Summary using Optimization Methods:**

*Background/Motivation:*
Optimization methods are instrumental in healthcare research for optimizing treatment strategies, resource allocation, and healthcare delivery. In the context of lung cancer research, optimization techniques can be applied to optimize screening protocols, treatment regimens, and resource allocation for improved patient outcomes.

*Research Questions:*
1. How can optimization methods be utilized to optimize lung cancer screening protocols and treatment regimens?
2. What are the potential impacts of optimized screening and treatment strategies on patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization?

*Methods:*
Reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning and deep Q-networks, will be employed for optimization. These algorithms will be applied to optimize screening protocols by maximizing detection rates while minimizing false positives. Additionally, treatment regimens can be optimized by maximizing patient survival rates while minimizing adverse effects and treatment costs. My reference is from Hrinivich (2020), who optimized the multistep treatment of patients with head and neck cancer using deep-q learning

*Potential Results:*
The potential results include optimized lung cancer screening protocols and treatment regimens that improve patient outcomes and optimize resource utilization. Furthermore, the study may identify novel strategies for personalized screening and treatment based on individual patient characteristics and risk profiles.

*Contributions:*
The study's contributions lie in leveraging optimization methods to improve lung cancer screening and treatment strategies. By optimizing resource allocation and treatment decision-making, the research can enhance patient outcomes and contribute to more efficient healthcare delivery in the context of lung cancer management.
