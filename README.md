# Predictive Modeling of Lung Cancer Risk: Integrating Machine Learning with Environmental and Lifestyle Factors

## Research Abstract
This research explores the predictive power of logistic regression in forecasting lung cancer levels based on various sets of variables, including smoking-related factors, environmental factors, and lifestyle-related variables. Using open-source software, we conducted logistic regression analysis to assess the prediction accuracy for each set of variables individually and in combination. The results reveal that smoking-related factors, environmental factors, and lifestyle-related variables contribute to predicting lung cancer levels with varying degrees of effectiveness. Furthermore, combining all variables significantly improves prediction accuracy. Visualization of prediction results through confusion matrices provides detailed insights into the model's performance. Overall, this study enhances understanding of the factors influencing lung cancer levels and underscores the importance of comprehensive assessment in predictive modeling for improved healthcare outcomes.
